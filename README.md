<h1 align="center">ExposePX API</h1>

**ExposePX** offers a vibrant online community for photographers, where users can seamlessly interact with each other through various features such as posting pictures, liking, commenting, and following fellow enthusiasts. Additionally, users have the ability to create and join events tailored to the photography scene, fostering connections and collaborations within the art shooting community. The platform also enables users to bookmark events of interest for easy access.

This section of the project is the frontend built to support the Django Rest Framework API from the backend, and it is powered by React Framework.

This project was built as my final Advanced Frontend Portfolio submission for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
